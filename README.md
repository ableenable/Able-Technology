Technology Stack

The Able eSIM website is built on the Shopify platform, utilizing a combination of Shopify's liquid templating language, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to deliver a responsive and interactive user experience. The site leverages Shopify's robust e-commerce capabilities while incorporating custom scripting and styling to meet our unique requirements.


Key Technologies:

Shopify: Utilized for e-commerce functionality, product management, and storefront operations.
Liquid: Shopify's templating language used to dynamically load content.
HTML5: The structure of the website is defined using the latest HTML standards.
CSS3: Styling is applied using CSS, with specific attention to responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
JavaScript: Interactive elements and client-side logic are powered by vanilla JavaScript, ensuring a dynamic user experience without heavy reliance on third-party libraries.
Specific Implementations
Custom Product Pop-Ups
For a seamless shopping experience, product details are displayed in custom pop-ups rather than redirecting users to dedicated product pages. This implementation enhances user engagement and simplifies the browsing process.


Dynamic Data Loading

To optimize performance and speed, product and eSIM package details are loaded dynamically using JavaScript. This method minimizes initial page load times and allows for a more responsive user interface.


SEO and Accessibility

Given the dynamic nature of our content and the use of JavaScript for key functionalities, special attention has been given to SEO and accessibility considerations. This includes the use of semantic HTML, appropriate ARIA labels, and ensuring that all content is accessible even if JavaScript is disabled, adhering to the principles of progressive enhancement.


Performance Optimization

To further improve site performance, images are lazily loaded, and critical CSS is inlined. JavaScript is minimized and deferred, reducing render-blocking resources. These optimizations contribute to better page speed scores and a smoother experience for the end-user.
